Sanguo Sha is a multiplayer card game based on the period of China's Three Kingdoms released by Yoka Games in China. This game contains a lot of allusions from chinese literature which in itself may be extremly difficult to translate in a way which could recreates chinese's culture profound meaning. I am actually working by myself on a translation of this card game to make a French version.
